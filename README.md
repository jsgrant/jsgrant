#  JOSHUA S. GRANT (JSGRANT)
### DESCRIPTION
Hey fellers & fellas, Grant here & welcome to my Github! The scope of this account has changed a lot during the past year or-so -- like many, the events of the 2020-2021 COVID-19 Pandemic has caused me to [reevalutate my life]() in some nontrivial ways. This profile has become the manifestation of that lingering affect and the promises to not take myself so seriously; To 'persue my bliss' and all other platitudes that may apply. This means spending time on things I **actually** care about, whether I expect them to bare fruit or not. 

### PRESENCE

### STATUS
-----
#### [2021-07-07] The Factory-Reset.
- Starting To Scheme Again; In Racket.
   - I'm treating the next few months as-if I was a complete beginner to programming.
   - Trying to build on more solid ground instead of the wet clay I've been working with.
   - The Racket ecosystem happens to be self-contained enough where I can focus more on theory.
   - And the language / ethos are similar enough to segue pretty seamlessly into Gerbil a 'Meta-Scheme'.

- Things To Keep-In-Mind Moving Forward.
   - Publish early & often; iteration Is the only win condition.
   - Be Open. About the process & my work generally.
   - Work on the things I *actually* care about.
